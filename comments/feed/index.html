					<description><![CDATA[A. Healthy Mindfulness and Plural Awareness are powerful and original values, which smartly reflect the subversion approach of the project in an overly traditional field. 

B. I would push “plural awareness” a bit further and suggest a bottom-up design process, along the lines of “nothing about us without us”, to ensure that diversity of experiences is also reflected in the project design.   

C. The proposed convening has promising outputs. I would ensure that patients’ experience is taken into account throughout the whole hackaton, and would suggest having patients distributed across the tech teams, to ensure that the end-user perspective is not lost along the process. I would also suggest invite scholars / sociologists that have studied the medical system in the US, and could make explicit a macro perspective on incentives/interests.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A. I find the addition of compassion as a container for learning really powerful; compassion is often framed as something an individual extends to another individual as opposed to a mechanism for group learning.

B. I would suggest thinking through how people with different abilities can participate in a dance party. 

C. As someone who identifies as male with 6 years of formal dance training (in another life), some deejaying and a lifetime of partying under my belt, I&#039;d be happy to help think about approaches to making the dance party fantastic. There are some timing questions I have about the experience portion of the retreat (does it happen during or before, what do the people who do not identify as males do?) and I have about 10 years of convening planning experience to offer to think that through!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A. I enjoyed your first value. I felt that was very self-aware and demonstrated a desire to be self-critical. 

B. For the action-driven one, I would also recommend thinking about building in ways to also be &quot;reflective&quot;. Move fast and break things doesn&#039;t always work and sometimes leads to big things getting broken. Sometimes the best action is no action!

c. I actually really like your convening, and wish this could happen! Its hard to find easy ways to apply institutional knowledge to real world problems because it often stays isolated in the institutions it was created in]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A/ What value struck me: the first one - “every voice in this community is valuable” - I like it because for there to be an inclusive and diverse community, where people have different voices - and conflicting ones - respecting and valuing different voices seems like a precondition to building meaningful community. That said, I struggle with valuing voices that are disrespectful, arrogant, or derogatory - might be worth distinguishing the voice from the content? E.g. instead of calling someone a racist, challenging the racist content of their speech? Its a subtle distinction, but one that this value (value everyone’s voice) made me consider

B/ What value would I suggest as an addition: I’ll do something I did for myself when crafting these values - try and find a way to “break them” - i.e. follow the values while breaking from the spirit. I would add something about either (a) working to address/delve into underlying issues (e.g. the structural issues that shape inequity and that underlie racist, etc. views) or (b) Something about actually shifting power in the space (e.g. one can believe in equity and amplify marginal voices, but still retain power) 

C/ Convening - A couple questions:
Problem definition: is it worth focusing on the teacher / student interaction? Might there be higher leverage areas to focus? What evidence/research/experience is pushing you to focus on this interaction as a key moment in the school to prison pipeline? 

Overall, I like the flow and how it builds from your main goal (building empathy among teachers and students) - and particularly appreciate how you use space, time, and physical objects to help make student emotions visible and more tangible for teachers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You clearly put a lot of thought into these principles and the envisioned convening. I was particularly impressed by your reminder not to ignore the materiality of interventions -- that systems of oppression are ultimately constituted by specific bodies in specific places at specific times. This is easy to forget in the design process. I would have liked to see an additional value regarding design within brave spaces. When handling sensitive topics, such as sexual assault, it is important to create spaces where people feel respected, their stories are honored, and yet others feel comfortable to challenge ideas with civility. This is particularly important for sexual assault, where the language used is often the source of confusion. I have seen multiple times survivors describing their rape, and men (usually) disagreeing with the use of the term. How do we honor the experience of the survivor in her own words while civilly challenging the resistance to her language? How do we arrive at consensus around the use of terms related to sexual assault? Regarding the convening,  I was wondering if you envisioned a formal curriculum being formed around these stories as a structure to provide boys clear values, skills and guidelines for sexual engagement moving forward (e.g., understanding consent and how to operationalize it in sexual settings.) I think it would be a good opportunity to engage survivors in the creation of this curriculum to ensure it covers the &quot;teachable moments&quot; from their experiences, and challenges the mindsets of the perpetrators. Regarding how I could help, this topic is actually one in which I have quite a bit of experience. I took a semester-long course in college about sexual assault and domestic violence prevention and interned for a semester at a SA/DV hotline. I also ran our college Women&#039;s Center, in which I organized campus programming on consent, supporting survivors, and challenges around reporting. I would love to support this effort if it moves forward!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A. The value that struck me as powerful, intriguing and unexpected is &#039;empathy&#039;. I agree that many of the issues that are listed in the post are as a result of the lack of respect and understanding from the relevant parties. Empathy is a critical mindset that is integral in a design process. Without empathy, the process will most likely fail. 

B. An additional value that I would include is &#039;collaboration&#039;. At the beginning of the unhackathon (and at subsequent stages), both hackers and government officials should work together to share insights, best practices and advice . 

C. I can play a role in making this convening happening by offering my skills in user-centered design and facilitating participatory design workshops. I like the idea of an &#039;unhackthon&#039; and in fact, I may adopt the ideologies of this particular convening in my future workshops!  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You actually put forth two values: honesty and justice. Honesty, especially the way you flesh it out (e.g., “some of my choices are not just”, “some of my actions are not consistent”), strikes me as powerfully liberating from the tyranny of image, even the image of being a “good person”. That kind of honesty is essential if we are to have any hope of actually acting in any way that isn’t just engineering how other people think about us. To have any hope of actually doing justice. I also hear in the way you word your examples a value of humility: you’re basically saying “I’m going to make mistakes”, “I can’t do everything”. That also might help keep you from the existential crisis of thinking that everyone is “only” in it for the PR!

I imagine you might propose something like a concert of honesty. The musicians would lead in speaking (or singing?) their reasons for doing what they’re doing, both the “I love what I’m doing” and “I gotta put food on the table” (and perhaps “why don’t you people pay us!?”)… but somehow you’d get everyone to reveal their own true rationales, even for being there. If done right, this could be healing. But it would probably be a one-time thing: we do that, but then go back to our same lives. What would it take to actually change both our selves and our systems?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What value struck as powerful, intriguing and unexpected?
Replicability and inclusivity

What value suggest as an addition?
System Thinking: The hackathon though being focused on personal growth also exposes participants about how their ideas can and will have broader impact on their communities and larger society. 
-------
@Other thoughts
How can we reach out to people who don&#039;t traditionally think of themselves as makers to make the circle of our value of inclusivity wider.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A. “We seek community” Tech-science fields often lack personal or cultural awareness. People are focused on the quality and quantity of research to examine what happens between people conducting the research. However, the relationships between researchers and within the community greatly affect the culture of research and consequently the method and even results of research endeavors, and much can be done on a personal level to influence the community. This value is interesting and important in encouraging grassroots action to build a conscious, non-stagnant research culture.

B. Constructive contribution. Individuals are the fundamental component of a community, and the community is not exclusive to but is greatly influenced by what each individual decides to bring to the table. In this regard, it is important for each person to think about what constructive offerings they can make to the community to shape the culture.

C. Unconference and workshop sessions that encourage communication and exchange of skills and values does seem critical in promoting the values. Just as a thought, it would be interesting to see a town-hall discussion of this specific topic of DIY vs DITO for direct self-assessment and socio-cultural awareness as a community.]]></description>
