					<description><![CDATA[We are starting to rely on algorithms to decide for us: hire the next employee, detect cancer, enroll in insurance, and grant parole. We do not know, however, how algorithms make these decisions, and a lot of them are clearly biased. ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative newsroom, revealed how the software currently used in our judicial system to predict subsequent crimes of offenders was racially biased, giving many African Americans a higher risk score though they [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#160; 5 values to keep in mind while thinking about algorithmic discrimination: Transparency: A lot of current problems come from the fact the process&#8211;dataset, models, usage, who, what, why, &#8230;&#8211;is kept private. Establishing some degree of transparency will alleviate inherent structural problems. Explainability: Many systems are treated as blackbox magic, and we are still unable to explain most of the results. Explainability would be essential in validating the usage. Questioning: Systematic errors often remain simply [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Queer Rights While queer rights in the US has not necessarily advanced to where most want it to be, my primary focus now will be on queer rights in Korea where I spent a significant number of years. Korea is still very conservative in these issues, as discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not outlawed (in fact, the military bans homosexuality and has undergone purges fairly recently, in 2017), and close to [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#160; &#160; While instances of overt, aggressive sexism have decreased during the past half-century, sexism persists, more embedded. Internalized sexism is one of the more subtle forms of contemporary sexism, not extensively examined but surprisingly influential as some studies illustrate. Internalized sexism is also prevalent in the perception of voice. A persuasive voice for public speaking and is often described as booming—loud, deep, and resonant—a quality more often physically tied to male voices than female ones. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Where am I? How far is my (unintended) reach? &#160; 2. I spent most of my queer childhood in a homophobic, misogynistic country. As I lingered in the periphery of online queer communities for years, I witnessed nameless, countless friends get outed, quit school (often &#8220;recommended&#8221; leave), run away from home, survive on part time jobs, quit because of abuse, take other part time jobs, repeat, and, eventually, disappear.
