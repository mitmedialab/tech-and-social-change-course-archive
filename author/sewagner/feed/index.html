					<description><![CDATA[(Adiel + Sarah) While it is difficult to plan a full mitigation strategy without a clear and certain approach to our topic&#8211;disaster resiliency and relief in Puerto Rico&#8211;we will attempt to list a few considerations that would hopefully mitigate any proposed strategy by making sure we are aware of any issue as it arises. Central to this is strategy is to try, to the best of our ability, to make no assumptions. Of course, this [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(apologies for the late post! Adiel and I each thought the other had posted this last week, and realized this week that neither of us had posted it at all&#8230;) We currently have several interviews scheduled, so this post will focus on our first completed interview, which insightful and helpful as we expand our knowledge on our particular topic.

					<description><![CDATA[Adiel and I have been working together to consider the topic of disaster relief, with a focus so far on Puerto Rico, but an intent to extend our scope to New Orleans (with some related scheduled interviews). In this comparison, we hope to uncover some of the nuances and specificity related to culture, politics, economics, and other broad systems and relationships related to a place that are exacerbated by disaster. We practiced Ideo’s suggested “5 [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While the &#8220;fake news crisis&#8221; has been identified as an issue contemporary to today, I believe that the topic might be better understood within a grander sociological history. Problems of agreeing on fact and fiction, especially related to science, have troubled humanity since scientific revolutions, accusations of heresy, as long as there is an association between knowledge and power. Facts come with power. News empowers. Fake news, when believed, also empowers. This is, ultimately, why [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Five Core Values for the Fake News Fiesta: No one is stupid. Maybe this seems to basic, but I don&#8217;t believe that it is. In order to begin to deal with this issue at all we need to break down barricades erected because of personal attacks. While not all facts are equal, all people are, and that is a very very important distinction to make. Diversity is good. This includes diversity in histories and diversity [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fake News Crisis Obviously this is a huge topic (but aren&#8217;t they all?). I&#8217;m from Kentucky; I remember even in middle school how divisive the topic of climate change was; I remember some of the brightest students in my class arguing with the science teacher against the facts. What can we do to help people trust experts again? LAW Laws already do a lot of work to prevent the spread of fake information. Laws regulate [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When we first landed in Baja, California, the question the M.Arch Core 3 studio had set out to answer&#8211;how can you design a winery for one of the driest regions in the world&#8211;already seemed wrong. We spent one week traveling from one winery to another, treated to drinks and food and admiration that was so clearly juxtaposed by the communities existing just outside of each winery’s wealthy purview. I will admit a certain excitement with [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m a third year student in the Masters of Architecture program here at MIT, which means I am now taking my 13th architecture studio (add 4 years undergraduate and count one studio per semester). Architecture and technology, I think, have a very complicated relationship&#8211;a lot of architects would like to claim that good buildings are technological advances, although often I think those claims are a slippery slope into a dissolution of definitions. But, since even the [&#8230;]]]></description>
