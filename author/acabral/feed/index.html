					<description><![CDATA[The year is 2065. It is nearly the 40 year anniversary of the Rebirth. There are celebrations planned all around the world that will last through the week. Naturally, there will be no fireworks or balloons or any of the celebratory devices that some of us older people remember from before they were banned. Instead people will celebrate with their environmentally friendly bubbles and compostable streamers. Against all odds, humanity has survived. Even many of [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After reviewing the IDEO method cards, there are a few that I would like to incorporate into my project: Foreign Correspondents: because climate change is a global issue, it is important to include diverse, international views. In addition, knowing more about how other countries tackle climate change will help broaden the ideas that I have for solutions here in the US. Historical Analysis: one of the biggest issues for climate change today is large corporations. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Climate change is one of the most serious issues facing the earth and its entire population. A recent UN report indicated that irreparable global damage could occur as soon as 2030 given the current trajectory. The potential risks include widespread drought, flooding, food shortages, and extinction of a variety of species. These issues will affect people around the globe, and is thus an issue that must be addressed quickly. Currently there are a number of [&#8230;]]]></description>

I also know that a wide set of expertise is needed to tackle tough issues. Collaboration &#8211; In order to develop the best solutions, there must be collaboration with the people whom Iâ€™d like to help.

					<description><![CDATA[We struggled to articulate the core tenets of individualism as an ideology. On the one hand, it was easy to see how individualism &#8212; carried to its logical conclusion &#8212; could result in anarchy. If the ultimate unit of power is the individual human, organized government institutions necessarily restrict the freedom of individuals. However, we settled on a modern Libertarian take on individualism, which views individuals as the basic unit of social analysis. While it [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This assignment is particularly difficult for me, as I feel that there are so many issues that need to be addressed. How does one choose just three? Then I think about what we&#8217;ve learned in class thus far and feel like maybe it&#8217;s not my place to even solve any of these issues. Regardless, in the words of Sam Cooke, &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but I know a change is gonna come&#8221;. I [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In 2017, I worked as a summer researcher with the Department of Biomedical Informatics at UCSD. Although I had essentially no knowledge of medicine, healthcare, or even biology; I wanted to work there so that I could explore ways to use my Computer Science skills in order to help others. My project for the summer was to work on a system that could help identify hidden stages for chronic diseases based on patient records. For [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up in a household where money was often the concern. As a child I remember living in an illegal basement apartment where my sister and I shared a bedroom while our mother slept in the living room. For years, my mother remained in a verbally and physically abusive relationship just so we could have another source of income. We rarely talked about plans for the future or career options, but I knew one [&#8230;]]]></description>
