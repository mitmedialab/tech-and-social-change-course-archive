					<description><![CDATA[What’s in a name? “Climate Change” has become such a polarized phrase in the United States that even uttering it feels like a political nonstarter. The phrase evokes the paradox of Voldemort: say his name and you’re a pariah. But don’t say his name and you’ll never really be directly addressing the real problem at hand. However we choose to name it, climate change is perhaps the single greatest problem facing current and future generations. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Climate change is perhaps the single greatest threat to future generations. To date, humans have failed to take adequate actions to stave off planetary collapse. A UN report issued this week describes a world of food shortages, floods, sea level rise, extreme weather events, wildfires, and massive coral reef die-offs as soon as 2040 if emissions continue at the current rate. The report concedes that while it is technically possible to change courses, it remains [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Issue 1: How do we reduce food waste?  According to latest research, the world produces 17% more food than it did 30 years ago, yet almost half of it never reaches our stomachs. In the US alone, 63 million tons of food are wasted each year, and currently accounts for around 21 percent of landfill volume. Architecture/Code Reduce barriers to composting by placing more composting bins in public places and businesses. In concert with education [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I do not have a personal connection to Rainforest Connection, the highly-publicized project provides fertile ground for analysis. Rainforest Connection (RFCx) has an ambitious mission: stop illegal deforestation, and in doing so, combat climate change. “If we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there, we can have an impact,” CEO Topher White explains, “It might be the cheapest, fastest way to fight climate change.” To achieve their mission, White [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey folks. I&#8217;m Rachael, a research assistant and MS candidate in the Media Lab&#8217;s Space Enabled group. Before MIT, I helped launch, grow, and dep. direct Global Forest Watch, an initiative that monitors deforestation in real-time from space. Previous to Global Forest Watch, I spent a year living in remote indigenous communities researching the use of technology to protect local rights, lands and culture. With a background in environmental policy, anthropology, and earth observation, I use [&#8230;]]]></description>
