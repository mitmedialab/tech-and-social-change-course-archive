					<description><![CDATA[HMW&#8230; Make gendered labor more desirable or socially acceptable to other gender(s)? View unequal gender ratio as a positive thing? Remove association of gender with gendered labor? Shape conversation about gender &#38; discrimination to be thoughtful, respectful, and natural, instead of contentious, annoying, and aggressive? Bring in people currently outside the conversation? Place gender in intersection with other aspects (e.g. race, ethnicity, religion, social class)? Make perception/awareness of daily and social work more like professional [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An organization called Male@MIT is founded to provide support for male-identifying students in professional, academic, and social settings. The executive board of the organization aims to host numerous workshops and events for males of different ethnicity and cultures, males from LGBTQ+ community, and males from traditionally masculine or feminine sports. As they try to cater events to numerous subgroups, Male@MIT applies for substantial funding from MIT. This causes a backlash from students and organizations who [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I observed Cheney Room on Monday afternoon. The Margaret Cheney Room was made in 1884 to provide a safe space for women. Access is granted to any self-identified women and non-binary individuals who asks. Despite the importance of gender in the motivation for founding of Cheney Room, the space itself does not have strong gender identity. There is a board of posters for events publicizing and available resources, but otherwise Cheney Room looks like any [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bullying is a pervasive problem in the US. 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) indicates that about 20% of students in grades 9–12 report being bullied on school property. Bullying can result in decreased academic performance, physical harm, and mental health issues for those bullied, and increased violence and substance abuse for those bullying. There are state laws and policies on bullying, as well as many federal and non-federal resources [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This convening is a mix of pitch competition and discussion workshop. The goal of the convening is to have people open up and share their thoughts and experiences regarding bullying. While this convening is not a direct solution to the problem, it will serve as the first step in understanding its graveness and how it impacts lives of individuals. The 5 core values of this convening are: We are respectful: We believe that everyone is [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[High Tuition in the US (and ensuing Student Debt) LAW + MARKET The government can regulate tuition by setting a maximum tuition limit, and then have each school find out how to meet the limit. This approach is a bit dangerous and could be either effective or have unexpected toll on certain groups depending on how each school deals with it. Schools may identify unnecessary portions in administration that can be streamlined, cut down on [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will write about a small project I did on assistive technology, since bigger projects I’ve worked on were more about overcoming technical challenges rather than addressing a social issue. Even through a technical problem, such as improving running time of an algorithm, does influence society (e.g. What solutions are now made viable through this improvement in performance?), I think it’s more beneficial to look at a focused case for this critique exercise. Through this [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#8217;m Abigail, an MEng student in EECS. I grew up in Texas and Seoul, Korea, which were two quite different experience. Education is highly-valued and highly-competitive in Korea. Especially back when I was in high school, school grades and national exam grades were completely relative, so that only the top 4% of students received A, the next 7% B, and so on. Moreover, schools had very rigid structure. My school, for example, had regular [&#8230;]]]></description>
