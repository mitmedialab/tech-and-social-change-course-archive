					<description><![CDATA[Having started from a very broad question the main challenge was finding the right balance of breadth and specificity for the HMW statement. To that end I went through the exercise and came up with a number of questions that I felt tackled both very specific and more general parts of the larger problem, e.g.: HMW make politics seem more consequential? HMW make civic participation and political engagement more fun? HMW make voters focus on [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In order to test some basic assumptions on the systems of political representation and get a deeper understanding of the role of “culture” in democracy I utilized IDEO’s ‘Cross-Cultural Comparisons’ framework. I engaged a friend, that had lived in the US briefly, but had only ever voted in elections in another country (Pakistan) to try, and draw out similarities and differences in the democratic systems that ostensibly share the same overarching ideals. The most recent [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Political Representation is the pillar upon which democracy rests. However, many take the effective implementation of this ideal for granted. The systems that allow citizens to choose their representatives, and then hold them accountable as they govern, are often conflated directly with the ideals that they are attempting to approximate. In reality, the systems almost exclusively dictate the very definition of the “representation” they create. Although some high-profile issues, such as the electoral college and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Modernizing and digitizing government is not a new idea. But while the pace of innovation and technological disruption has left the larger world unrecognizable, government and politics have been extremely slow to change. The inherent complexity of the problems to be solved, and built-in systemic inertia, have meant that any major changes in how the government functions have been difficult, if not impossible. This has left many citizens, and would-be solution designers, frustrated. Many naturally [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Political Representation Government, and political representation in particular, are long overdue for modernization. Most of the systems in place for electing representatives are holdovers from the technological limitations of centuries past. For instance, the fact that individuals are restricted to choosing candidates for national legislatures from their geographical vicinity, rather than those that represent their views best, made sense when it was only realistic to run and consume local political campaigns. But with the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a strategy consultant in the private sector for much of my (admittedly short) professional career, I have had limited opportunities to work on projects that explicitly aimed to effect large scale social change. However, technology played a central role in essentially all solutions that we ended up recommending to our clients. One project in particular resonated with a number of themes that we have already touched upon in this course. A US telecommunications provider [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Before starting my MBA at MIT Sloan last fall I worked as a strategy consultant exclusively serving technology and telecommunications clients. Although I flirted with an early career in non-profits and international development, working close to the technology industry was, in many ways, an inevitability for me. As a hopeless technophile and unapologetic geek from before I can even remember, it was not long before my love for consuming and using technology was converted into [&#8230;]]]></description>
