					<description><![CDATA[We’re interested in exploring how decentralized learning networks might be used to connect educators, administrators, and eventually policymakers and supporters (investors, funders, etc.) in order to spread creative learning practices and to help scale up creative learning approaches. We propose grounding this exploration in a pilot research project focused at first on Nairobi and Johannesburg. Nairobi and Johannesburg are nascent hubs for innovations in learning. However, educators in both cities (across the two cities and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1/ Values I struggled with this exercise &#8211; in some unexpected ways. I’ve helped articulate values in very different contexts and scales (e.g. drafting values for an education startup, a university, a classroom); drafted my own values as part of workshops and trainings; and developed values in very different ways (individually, facilitated, collaboratively, and along different timescales &#8211; in a workshop, a week, or stretched out over a few weeks in a deliberate/consensus driven process).

					<description><![CDATA[Assignment: Write a brief reflection on the in-class design exercise. What are the politics you identified in the artifact your group worked on as it currently exists? How was the experience of explicitly translating the viewpoint you chose into an object? Include photos of your designs. Group: Kenneth Arnold, Yusuf Ahmad, Abigail Choe, Julie Ricard We started the reflection by brainstorming the lexical field of words associated with amusement park: adventure, fun, fear, screaming, stress, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found this assignment incredibly useful for rethinking some of the problems I’m working on: from problem definition to thinking about the different levers that I might interact with in my work. The three issues I’ve chosen to discuss here: 1/ Connecting educators: Creative Learning in South Africa and Kenya 2/ Helping teachers and designers unleash their creativity: creative learning design platform 3/ Helping people make sense of the world around them: constructionist media 1/ [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Overview I spent the past four years as one of the curriculum leads for a pan-African university that aimed to create a network of tertiary institutions across Africa. The principle goal of our work was to support young, talented Africans through intentional leadership development, an emphasis on project based, constructivist learning, and exposure to peers and mentors from across the continent and the world. Because of a lack of public investment in higher ed, we [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love how Salman Rushdie puts it: to understand a life you need to swallow the world. A multitude of things have brought me to where I am today. I grew up as a child of two immigrants, moving around Canada and the US as our family found its footing. Questions about assimilation, socioeconomic mobility, and how identity shapes access to opportunities left an imprint on me pretty early in my life. I started off [&#8230;]]]></description>
