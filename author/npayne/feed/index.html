					<description><![CDATA[Those who control information tend to wield an outsized portion of power. The prolific 20th century author, Tom Clancy, probably said it best. “The control of information is something the elite always does, particularly in a despotic form of government.

					<description><![CDATA[To me, it was the most absurd statement a digital leader for a top newspaper company could make — worse, I wouldn’t know until much later that the trajectory I helped set my smaller news organization on wasn’t much better. “You simply can’t put the cat back in the bag,” he said, referring to his contention that there was no hope of reversing the newspaper industry’s practice of providing free articles online. He contended the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since the outset of my journalism career — a roller coaster ride that began nearly in concert with the first iPod landing on store shelves in October 2001 — I have lived life with one foot stuck in analog reality and the other planted in a digital future.
