					<description><![CDATA[I do realize the ease of writing about one’s values as opposed to being true to them in action. It is a constant struggle towards our ideal Self.

					<description><![CDATA[The three social issues that I am looking at through Lessig&#8217;s levers of change are: Child Abuse &#38; Rape ; Unjust Labels (Black; White; People of Color); Feeling safe and comfortable on the street Issue 1: Child Abuse &#38; Rape During my recent trip to India, I came across several mentions in the media about cases of child abuse and rape.

					<description><![CDATA[&#8211; What’s the full scope of the problem? During my undergrad, I had created a one of its kind Indian language word building game ‘AKSHARIT’. Unlike English which has a 26 letter set, Hindi and most other Indian languages have ~40 consonants and ~15 vowels (used like diacritic marks in French), leading to ~600 possible letters.
