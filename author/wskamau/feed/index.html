					<description><![CDATA[Mitagation Strategy For my project, Safeguarding DIY Biology, I will propose a mitigation strategy (regulation) that combines the levers of law, markets, and code. This issue, like the many other technology-focused projects discussed in our class, requires a multifaceted approach to anticipate and stem nefarious use-cases. Proposal: A centralized federal agency to oversee gene synthesis and biotechnology product licensing in the United States. Key Provisions: A presiding council consisting of members from the Environmental Protection [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#160; For my IDEO Design Research Method, I used the card &#8216;collage.&#8217; The activity involves having participants create a visual representation of the various sides of an issue. I chose this method because it allows for a secondary method of visual mapping, alongside the ecosystem map. While the ecosystem map does a good job of identifying the various stakeholders and how they are affiliated with the issue, in my case safeguarding DIYBiology, it doesn&#8217;t hold much [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interview Subjects: A DNA cryptographer, two post-docs (Broad/Whitehead Institute) Big takeaways: DIYBiology isn&#8217;t the threat: The biggest surprise for me from these interviews has been that I may have overestimated the potential threat of nefarious do it yourself biologists. While the two post-docs I interviewed had heard of the DIYBiologists, neither seemed to think that it would be feasible (from a technical basis) to gather the infrastructure or technical know-how needed to make something that [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Biology is hard to do by yourself. More than just the collection of theories and logic it&#8217;s grounded in, the physical and organizational infrastructure required to develop projects make the barrier to entry quite steep. This makes it ever the more surprising that in the last ten or so years, a community of “do it yourself” biologists have found a way to actualize projects on scales approaching those of institutionally supported laboratories. Concurrently, the past [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vaccinations Background: Vaccine controversies have occurred since almost 80 years before the terms vaccine and vaccination were introduced, and continue to this day. Despite scientific consensus that recommended vaccines are safe and effective, unsubstantiated scares regarding their safety still occur, resulting in outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. [Reproduced from Wikipedia/Vaccines.gov] Code; Vaccines in agriculture are not infrequently added to water supplies. The government at the municipality, state, or federal level could surreptitiously add vaccines [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While an undergrad, I studied the role of arsenic in water systems with a particular emphasis on Maine. Arsenic has long been acknowledged to have an adverse effect on human health. Found naturally in the Earth’s crust, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 200 million people worldwide are exposed to elevated levels of arsenic in drinking water. The WHO and US Environmental Protection Agency set a safety standard of 10 ug/L of arsenic, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi all! My name is Sebastian and I am a first-year graduate student in the Sculpting Evolution group at the Media Lab. My background is in biochemistry and our group works to engineer self-replicating systems using biology. Perhaps the most relevant of these for this class is the gene drive, which can allow an engineered trait or characteristic to spread hereditarily across an entire population — locally or globally. As you might imagine, ‘self-replicating technology’ [&#8230;]]]></description>
