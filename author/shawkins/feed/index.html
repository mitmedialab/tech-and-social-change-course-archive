					<description><![CDATA[I did the assignments out of order, so this is my dystopian fiction; please see my assignment from last week for an examination of known unknowns and mitigation strategies. My story is meant to examine from the perspective of a deeply misogynistic person how they might be able to live in a world in which a woman has been completely reduced to the image or representation of herself. The consequence, as I explore in this, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Note: I wrote one 2 page document that combines both anticipation of negative outcomes as well as a description for how to mitigate the disasters. Following the insights of my “comparative and historical analysis” of how both Harvard and Stanford, the most wealthy schools in America, have designed and staged their interventions on the rape crisis at their universities. Through these interviews, I realized that many solutions already exist, and that the most valuable ground [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WARNING: the following content is polarizing. I advise those to only read if they have a truly open mind about the issue of the rape crisis and are willing to be more flexible about our current understanding of &#8220;victim&#8221; and &#8220;perpetrator&#8221;. During my interview with a psychology professor and lecturer who teaches about social and cultural causes of rape on campus we tried a version of &#8220;role-playing&#8221;. The goal of the exercise was to come [&#8230;]]]></description>

I had originally scheduled the call with her to talk about what excited me about this class, but as the call went on, it became clear that this should count as my first interview, as both of us have had personal experiences with the problem as students and as women in the workplace. Right now, she runs a company that she founded that helps women seek [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Due to awareness of my own identities and privileges, I have chosen to tackle sexual assault college campuses. The United States Department of Justice highlights a chilling statistic: one out of every four female undergraduates will be victim to some form of sexual assault before graduation. There is an average of 293,066 victims ages 12 or older of rape and sexual assault each year in the U.S. This means 1 sexual assault occurs every 107 [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Core Values: THE &#8220;RATATOUILLE&#8221; PRINCIPLE: a good idea can come from anywhere. (Forgive my reference to the Disney movie if you haven&#8217;t seen it) The movie&#8217;s fictive famous chef died asserted the idea that &#8220;anyone can cook&#8221; and was met with skepticism from those who felt &#8220;well, everyone can cook, but should everyone?&#8221; At the end, the revelatory moment is found in this quotation: Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere. There&#8217;s [&#8230;]]]></description>

The following statistics are directly from the NPR report: There are more than 50 million public school students in the U.S. and as many as 1 in 5 shows signs of a mental health disorder. Most of the nearly 5 million affected students — nearly 80 percent — won’t [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my first blog post, I reflected on my startup. Here, I’ll go a bit deeper into rethinking why it failed to evoke the social change I had planned. To use the schematic provided by Lessig, the full scope of the problem involves the constraints created by the market, by the law, by social norms, and by the architecture of the solution. In the case of my company, I think I had done a good [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In 2016, I founded a company as a senior at Stanford University. I had spent the three previous summers doing internships in the music industry. These internships had revealed to me how behind the scenes, the ‘culture machine’ struggled with entrenched social inequalities. I was astounded, also, by the lack of advanced technology and wondered what role technology could play. Many close friends of mine at the time were musicians struggling to ‘make it’: despite [&#8230;]]]></description>
