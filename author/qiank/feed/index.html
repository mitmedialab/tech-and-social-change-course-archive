Remove the bad: HMW make sure people have equal access to voting and that all votes are [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One major consequence or potential catastrophe of the anti-voter-suppression strategy of encouraging absentee ballot voting for people who might face a lot of the structural issues presented by in-person voting (long lines because of understaffed locations or lack of poll locations at all, faulty machines, limited early voting locations, lack of transportation) is that there is the potential for a huge number of these votes to get rejected as has happened many times in previous [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The faraway land of the Unruly and Strange Administration (U.S.A) had long been known amongst the members of its galaxy for its unruly and strange administrative policies. 5000 years ago, a senile but well-loved ruler of the nation took it upon himself to rewrite the constitutional laws that had governed his country for millennia. Inspired by the ancient Broadway show Hamilton, he decided to institute his own system of voting democracy in his country. “Our [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The topic I want to work on for the rest of the semester is voter disenfranchisement / voter suppression in the United States. While voting often seems like an ineffectual way of making change, I think it’s important to explore who is actively being blocked from voting. This is a topic that affects a lot of marginalized, underserved, and oppressed communities whose livelihoods can often be directly and negatively impacted by legislations or policies passed [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[VALUES: We recognize our position. These gatherings will center on where we can go and what we can do in the world as students at elite universities, which is a position that we strive to recognize and deal with as it relates to a number of other positions of power that each of us occupy along various axes of privilege. We consider all of these positions and what kind of consequences and meanings they have [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Because I was not able to participate in the group design exercise in class, I am instead submitting a reflection based on Winner&#8217;s &#8220;Do Artifacts Have Politics?&#8221; that seems to be one of the crucial texts upon which we&#8217;re basing our analysis this week. I thought this reading was particularly interesting because it connected to the previous week&#8217;s discussion about the four levers of social change. The politics of an artifact can also be read [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reparations One issue I&#8217;m really interested in working on is reparations for slavery and colonization, particularly in the United States. This is a pretty big idea but I think reparations are an essential part of working towards reconciling a lot of unjust foundations that this world is built upon. Law: Echoing the calls for reparations that Ta-Nehisi Coates made in his well-known article (The Case for Reparations), reparations policies could go through law and be made [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m writing about a project i did in high school, as gaining some time and distance from it has produced some reflections I think can be framed in terms of the questions asked in class. I spent the last two years of my high school career working on a program at my public school to help students find networks of other students and improve their studying skills and ultimately their school performance. This was meant [&#8230;]]]></description>

I&#8217;m studying a mix of CS and ethnic studies, and am interested in intersections of art and critical studies of race, gender, class, and the like with emerging and existing technologies. I come to this class hoping to learn as much as I can about what the technology and social change space looks like, what work has been done in the field, and what [&#8230;]]]></description>
