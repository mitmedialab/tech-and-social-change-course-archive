					<description><![CDATA[Values It was a wonderful exercise to name some values that I want to bring to my work. My current work falls far short of these values, but stating them can help me navigate towards them. I draw these values from two streams: the stated goals and values of the Christian faith (acknowledging that many Christians have acted in opposition to those values), and from aspects of many organizations and communities that I admire. &#160; [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“Algorithmic fairness” has become a hot topic, but it’s not really solving the right problem. I’ve only tangentially worked in this area, so apologies in advance for my ignorance. Recent accusations that algorithms exhibit racial and other biases have led to widespread efforts to make machine learning (and other sociotechnical systems) more “Fair, Accountable, and Transparent”. But “fair” does not imply “just”. If we were to start history over from a blank slate, some of [&#8230;]]]></description>

But as I have been approaching the end of my PhD, something has been weighing on me: I still don’t know how to use all I’ve been learning to have a positive impact in the world.
