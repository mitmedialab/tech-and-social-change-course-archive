					<description><![CDATA[As an overall update from this project, I have learned from method card, interviews and previous homework assignments, the topic of urban environmentalism is too large in scope to effectively pursue within this semester. However, as I have mentioned in my previous posts, I have found the following insights: decreasing the education gap to highlight issues of climate change making actions for environmentalism more convenient focusing on reducing large scale consumption via food and materialism [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For my semester project, I am trying to understand the issue of urban environmentalism and who to hold accountable for righting issues of climate change. While I haven&#8217;t honed in on a particular solution yet, the answers seem to lie in: decreasing the education gap to highlight issues of climate change making actions for environmentalism more convenient focusing on reducing large scale consumption via food and materialism incorporating urban environmentalism with current ideas and seemingly [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I, unfortunately, haven&#8217;t been documenting the necessary updates about my interview on the class site. A continued update of the progress will be published throughout today. As such, I wanted to give some updates about where I am in this project. I began by interviewing 3 peers from states with different political affiliations to understand how their political background can impact their understanding of climate change and environmentalism.Â  From these interviews, I got perspectives from [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that we have until 2030 to limit the effects of climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. Warming greater than 1.5 C will lead to global catastrophe by extinction of several species, drought, heat waves and food shortages that will disproportionately impact those in poverty. Since beginning college, I have read more and more articles detailing the negative impacts of climate change and more importantly [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When designing, I would like to maintain these five values: Understanding &#8211; All participants and designers work to fully understand the extent and nuances of the problem being solved. This core value should exceed empathizing with individuals &#8212; still an important step &#8212; by understanding the larger systems at play that influence this problem space and communities within. Inclusion and Collaboration &#8211; Design should not be a privilege or have a barrier of entry. I [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When thinking of what avenues I would like to create social change in, I often consider climate injustice, economic injustice and mobility injustice as the three biggest areas to pursue. These potential issues, when overlapped, tend to impact the same group of people the most regardless of community norms and geographic location: low-income people, people of color and people with disabilities. I&#8217;ve also recognized that I have felt the negative impacts of all three of [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My freshman year, I participated in a winter session study abroad program in Sao Paulo, Brazil where I worked with fellow Harvard students and Brazilian students to help find a solution to Sao Paulo&#8217;s transportation problem. Hosted by Sao Paulo Transit and MobiLab &#8212; a think-tank/incubator for &#8220;innovative&#8221; ideas as it relates to transportation to Sao Paulo, this was my first encounter with human-centered design and the design process &#8212; so I didn&#8217;t have the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My name is Zaria Smalls and I study a special concentration called Design Engineering and Social Change &#8212; a major where I focus on how technology has previously inhibited or promoted social change and how future design processes can be intentional in that change. I can&#8217;t give a clear explanation of how I got to my special concentration because it wasn&#8217;t until very recently that I could vocalize what I cared about but I can [&#8230;]]]></description>
