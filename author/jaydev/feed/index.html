					<description><![CDATA[Problem Statement: How might we help men recognize and share emotional (and other forms of gendered) labor? &#160; 10 Divergent Ideas: Present men with a list of gendered tasks and have them think of the last time someone did that for them, as well as the last time they did that. Challenge men to do a “feminine” task for 3 another male identifying person in their life and see how they react. Keep a labor [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my project to learn more about the way movement can be used to enable vulnerability and convey embodied knowledge, I knew it would be important to better understand how students move and carry themselves through a public space (and how that differs based on gender identity). To do so, I conducted a fly-on-the-wall observations for approximately 30 minutes (from 10:10-10:42pm) in the lobby of Building 10 last week. Heading into the observation, I had [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the past few years, the term ‘emotional labor’ has become more and more common. It refers to a wide range of activities, both personal and professional, that often go unnoticed and almost always go unpaid, but are critical to maintaining the foundation and structure of professional and social environments and relationships. A range of things fall into the bucket of emotional labor- from smiling at strangers to checking-in on and emotionally supporting loved ones [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Values In my work, I aspire to be&#8230; Thoughtful and active: It is important to deconstruct an issue by making all of its parts visible, empathizing with a range of perspectives on it, and constructing a broader network of qualitative, quantitative, relational, and contextual information to fully understand it. But just thinking through an issue is insufficient&#8211;the work must inspire some form of positive action.

					<description><![CDATA[By Ezinne Uzo-Okoro, Nathan Payne, Jay Dev, and Shaurya Agarwal A passport, simply defined, is a method of providing identification for each person in a political, geographic or community subdivision using a number of factors — visual, biometric and coded. It is a tool used by governments (a person/group of people who set guidelines for behavior in a given community of people) to track and control the movements of people who live under its purview. These forms [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have written in this blog before about my background in policymaking and data analysis, and that is the lens that I bring to this course. Two things that I have not written about are two personal interests of mine- audio storytelling and deconstructing masculinity. From these three topics arise three issues to potentially be addressed through this course- one on state data and privacy, one that was compellingly covered last year by one of [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to coming to MIT, I used to work with non-profits in the greater Washington, DC area to measure their outcomes and evaluate their impact. I was doing this as a research associate at a research organization, a non-profit itself. Entering into the project, I had no idea of the concepts of logic modeling, performance measurement, and theories of change. But I was in for a steep learning curve. The project was funded by a [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had just graduated college and felt like I had hit the first-job jackpot: I was moving down to Washington, DC to work at a policy research organization. While the topic area, health policy, would take me away from my undergraduate interest of urban policy, I was promised an exciting position conducting policy simulation of a wide range of health insurance policies. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act was about to be implemented, the data on [&#8230;]]]></description>
