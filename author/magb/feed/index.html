					<description><![CDATA[The story of Jason and Miriam happened because most news organisations in the nondescript future left their own platforms to reach a much bigger one on social platforms, just as NowThis famously did. It is not a likely future as most news companies has seen the value of subscription based business models and have a hard time giving sharing the income with Facebook or others. The monetization history of must social networks has also been [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“Can you help me out one second?” asked Jason leaning back in his chair in the almost empty newsroom. “Something’s not working.” “I said something is not working,” he repeated but this time loud enough to cut through the noise cancelling in his web producer’s headset. “Huh…?” she said removing the ear muffs while swirling in her chair. “The story won’t publish. The Platform says it’s violating the policies on accuracy.” “Oh, let me see…” [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The foreign correspondent method unveiled that several issues relating to how Journalists and Developers work together in newsrooms are international. For this I interviewed editorial people that work closely with tech people plus one developer in USA, Canada, United Kingdom and Norway. Many of their take-aways align with my own experiences in Denmark. There is great potential. Developers bring both new tools to the newsroom but also other viewpoints that can help create better Journalism. [&#8230;]]]></description>

And one piece of feedback that we keep getting is, that the voters are having a hard time figuring out what the political parties actually stand for and how they differ. In Denmark we have a multiparty system with about 10 political parties that overlap a lot and tend to crowd around the center of [&#8230;]]]></description>

Every time you enter a new country, you get a stamp in the passport thus creating a track record of all travel. A standardized picture of me is in it along with my fingerprints and signature.

She the Nieman Fellowship at Harvard and me the Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her focus is managing how your 269-year-old newspaper moves from broadsheet paper to infinitely smaller LED screens. Mine [&#8230;]]]></description>
