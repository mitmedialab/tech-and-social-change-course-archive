					<description><![CDATA[A few of my interviews have extolled the values of radical honesty and showing up authentically, as authenticity is one of the few arenas in which mediation and trust-building can thrive. However, doing so depends on everyone being as open, clear, and as vulnerable to each other as they can be, which we know for a number of reasons is especially hard for many of the kids and just as many of the adults to [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston has been one of a few cities across the country to put some effort towards mitigating the over-incarceration of young children of color, otherwise known as the school-to-prison pipeline. Across the country, the school-to-prison pipeline is a pattern that can begin from pre-K and follows a child throughout their youth. Data shows that children who have been given out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, or otherwise fall victim to zero-tolerance policy within the school systems are far [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Five values driving this work: We believe every voice in this community is valuable: Every person&#8211;whether they&#8217;re a student, parent, teacher, administrator, or otherwise&#8211;has something valuable to add to this picture and we value their opinion and perspective. We recognize that this issue is best solved as a community, with everyone represented. We believe in equity: This conversation is one part of an ecosystem of structural inequities that systemically disenfranchise black and brown people in [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[by Feroze Shah, Zaria Smalls, Maia Woluchem A passport is a tangible, internationally accepted, physical document that serves multiple purposes for legal citizens of a ‘national entity’. Formally, it serves to provide identification, prove citizenship, enable access to state services and allow physical travel between recognized states. In order to function, it relies on an international regime of standardization and mutual recognition. The resulting processes that denote entry and exit from each port allow this physical [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chronic Housing Instability in the City of Boston The City of Boston, like many of our coastal cities, is dealing with a housing crunch like no other. A shortage of affordable housing is pushing people out of affordable rentals and homeownership, and increasing the prevalence of housing instability at the margins, including evictions, housing discrimination, and predatory landlords. There&#8217;s a lot the city is currently trying to do, and a lot it&#8217;s not able to [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my previous life I was a policy researcher, working with communities to measure the impact of federal and local policy in their neighborhoods. An essential part of that work was community surveys, something that often our partner organizations would see as important but laborious and expensive tasks. On one particular project, we decided to invest in tablet computers to complete our community surveys, making a previously arduous job a more streamlined endeavor that could [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As long as I’ve been alive, I’ve been afraid of the poor outcomes of even my most banal decisions. I used to be that cripplingly shy kid in most social situations, ruining any idea that I’d be the confident, loud, and overbearing Nigerian auntie I guess I was supposed to be. Better a weird kid than a difficult one, I guess. Though I&#8217;ve worked hard to be a 9-5 extrovert, it’s still difficult for me [&#8230;]]]></description>
