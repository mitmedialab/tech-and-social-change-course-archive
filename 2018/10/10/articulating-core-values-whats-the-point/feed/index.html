But having read this piece I am persuaded of the importance of instilling a sense of thoughtful consideration and robust thinking for any ethical attempt at problem solving.
I also liked ‘Courage’ and the idea of brave spaces. Would love to learn more about this concept.

I personally have a strong interest in South Africa and its history. I have a number of local connections who work with communities in Durban and Cape Town, specifically on issues related to informal labor, that could be useful for gathering relevant resources and context for tackling other systemic issues such as education.]]></description>
