					<description><![CDATA[A. I find the addition of compassion as a container for learning really powerful; compassion is often framed as something an individual extends to another individual as opposed to a mechanism for group learning.

B. I would suggest thinking through how people with different abilities can participate in a dance party. 

C. As someone who identifies as male with 6 years of formal dance training (in another life), some deejaying and a lifetime of partying under my belt, I&#039;d be happy to help think about approaches to making the dance party fantastic. There are some timing questions I have about the experience portion of the retreat (does it happen during or before, what do the people who do not identify as males do?) and I have about 10 years of convening planning experience to offer to think that through!]]></description>
