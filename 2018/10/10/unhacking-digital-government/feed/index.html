					<description><![CDATA[A. The value that struck me as powerful, intriguing and unexpected is &#039;empathy&#039;. I agree that many of the issues that are listed in the post are as a result of the lack of respect and understanding from the relevant parties. Empathy is a critical mindset that is integral in a design process. Without empathy, the process will most likely fail. 

B. An additional value that I would include is &#039;collaboration&#039;. At the beginning of the unhackathon (and at subsequent stages), both hackers and government officials should work together to share insights, best practices and advice . 

C. I can play a role in making this convening happening by offering my skills in user-centered design and facilitating participatory design workshops. I like the idea of an &#039;unhackthon&#039; and in fact, I may adopt the ideologies of this particular convening in my future workshops!  :)]]></description>
