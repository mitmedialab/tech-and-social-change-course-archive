					<description><![CDATA[I think this is great and really inspiring! Thank you for writing such a thoughtful blog post.

The value that stuck out to me the most was &quot;We listen with radical humility&quot;. I especially love the inclusion of the word &quot;radical&quot; here. Climate change is a large multi-faceted issue that has causes and implications in a variety of fields. In addition, it has become politicized (at least in the US) and thus can often lead to tense discussions. I believe a value such as this is necessary to truly solve the issue, as many people will not agree with each other. In particular, keeping in mind the positive intent of others, as mentioned above, is especially powerful.

I think a value that can be added is a commitment to discovering the path that got us to this point of climate chaos. While you touch on diversity a bit in the fourth value and mention in your intro that climate change is a result of many different actions, I think it is important to remember that many people across the world do not necessarily believe in or care about climate change. Discovering why that is the case, both in terms of the present and past, will help to create stories that can address those issues.

I really like the idea of the convening, particularly the thought of bringing climate experts to a place like West Virginia. As you mentioned, the issue is very politicized and having events always take place in locations such as California and NYC doesn&#039;t help to reach out to the mass amount of people whose views and thoughts need to be considered. I would love to help out by helping to pair people up and perhaps by arranging a small hackathon or workshop where I teach people how to easily find and visualize data for their own usage. I feel that having access to data is a great way to help people acquire knowledge and perhaps help them to see something that had not before.]]></description>
