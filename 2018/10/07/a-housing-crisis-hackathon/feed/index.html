					<description><![CDATA[A: Humility - I really liked your point on humility. I think the first step to designing at and for the margins is realising our own inadequacies as the designers and the importance of bottom-up collaboration.
B: Radical collaboration/inclusion - I would suggest going beyond collaboration to ensure that the people you&#039;re solving for have a seat at the table and that their voices are not just heard, but guide the hackathon itself. 
C: I would think about the spatial redesign of the hackathon space and findings ways to ensure that it&#039;s a comfortable space for people who are not used to being in a tech/hackathon setting. I would also rethink the conventional understandings of &quot;skillsets&quot; to ensure that people we&#039;re designing for are also valued in their teams.]]></description>
