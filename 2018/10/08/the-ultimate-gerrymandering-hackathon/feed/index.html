					<description><![CDATA[This a really great problem to try and tackle. Gerrymandering seems so pervasive in the current political climate and seems to be getting even more pronounced. Its also timely, as the next census is coming up soon. The value that struck me as particularly powerful was the &quot;Understand the ripple effects&quot;, gerrymandering is something that is hard to grasp at first glance why it might be such a critical issue, its only after considering the downstream effects of gerrymandering from voter supression to the make-up of the courts. 

This convening shoulds very interesting. Is the goal to come up with a way to determine a clear metric for gerrymandering&#039;s effects? I could see my role in a project like this as an advocate to get scientists interested in politics and activism. Its something that I have experience in and is an underutilized demographic.]]></description>
