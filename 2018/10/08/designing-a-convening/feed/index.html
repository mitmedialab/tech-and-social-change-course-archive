					<description><![CDATA[A: Of the values listed, I found the &#039;people can change people&#039; as the most visceral. Optimism in this regard is important, in my opinion, will certainly be a fuel for change.

B: I would suggest adding something along the lines of &quot;We are all important&quot; as a value. This steers away from &quot;We are inclusive&quot; or &quot;We are respectful&quot; more in the sense to celebrate each individual for their unique traits and personality qualities. If someone is a victim of bullying or comes to recognize past acts of bullying, this thought can be easily discarded and lead to undeserved loss of self-esteem.

C: I see the proposed convening occurring in middle school and high school settings since these form the socials contexts in which most people first encounter bullying or suffer the most because of it. I see myself as being a enthusiastic conversation moderator in a breakout session. I feel that I have the energies to make people feel heard and foster group cohesion that would make this a edifying experience.]]></description>
