					<description><![CDATA[I was most surprised by the value of “reimagining inclusivity,” which is a more aggressive or proactive way to think about the re-entry process by taking actions to help people rebuild their lives out of prison. It’s easy to agree with the concept of inclusivity; it’s more challenging to think about what steps I could take to foster inclusivity.

I like the idea of putting this installation in the public, where people will come across it in their daily lives. It fits with the idea of helping to bring returning citizens back into the community. Given what I know of Cambridge so far, I would anticipate people in Cambridge welcoming this installation. I see a series of performances throughout the day, perhaps with returning citizens presenting their stories more than once to reach different people. 

I could play a role by helping to spark conversation and reflection among the crowd. I could walk among people and ask questions spurred by the stories and artwork. I could staff a table where people write their thoughts on a computer, perhaps asking them what steps they would be willing to take to help others in the re-entry process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I liked the second core value: reimagining inclusivity, but think it can be further expanded so that people really do accept diversity and inclusivity in their direct neighborhood not just &quot;somewhere in society.&quot; I do not have any personal experience or relationship with anyone who has been incarcerated, but I can help publicize the event in school and residential area, as well as participate as an active listener and supporter. I wonder if returning citizens will be afraid to speak in the fear of being visually identified as a returning citizen, and wonder if there is a way to make the environment feel safer.]]></description>
