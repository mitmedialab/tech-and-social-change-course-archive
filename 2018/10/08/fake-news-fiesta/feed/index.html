					<description><![CDATA[I really like this idea! Here are my thoughts:
A. &quot;News is not always new&quot; is a really good value and I find it really intriguing. I feel like we forget that often news is part of a much longer history, much of which contests our lived understanding of the world. That&#039;s an important distinction to make here and I&#039;m glad it showed up here!
B. I&#039;d also maybe add something about that describes being open to new ideas. I can imagine that this is one of those situations that could be ripe for debate if someone hears something that doesn&#039;t make sense in their conception of the world. I think it could help to have everyone commit to being open to whatever they&#039;re hearing without feeling the need to offer a rebuttal. I like the way you&#039;ve framed it above as an opportunity to share stories, and I think this could help to really make it an even more open space :)
C. I think this convening could be a very cool event! I think I&#039;ve seen smaller attempts to create a diverse conversation like this and I definitely believe it can be done. As students, I think we could help by creating the space and the environment that feels neutral enough to have this discussion. Luckily all we really need is a space and food and our party guests, so that&#039;s a fairly small lift. It could be a good idea to test this among smaller groups of people first, so maybe host a small fiesta with 10-15 people to see how that goes, and then scaling up if it makes sense.]]></description>
