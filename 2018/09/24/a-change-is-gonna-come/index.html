	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This assignment is particularly difficult for me, as I feel that there are so many issues that need to be addressed. How does one choose just three? Then I think about what we&#8217;ve learned in class thus far and feel like maybe it&#8217;s not my place to even solve any of these issues. Regardless, in the words of Sam Cooke, &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but I know a change is gonna come&#8221;. I know that I would like to be part of that change, and at this point, here are three things I&#8217;ve been thinking about working on to do so.</p>
<ol>
<li>The housing crisis, in particular the cycle of evictions for low income people. This is inspired by a book I&#8217;ve been reading, called <em>Evicted</em><em>: Poverty and Profit in the American City</em>, by Matthew Desmond. As with any major issue, there are of course multiple sub issues that make up the problem. Simply, however, I want to work towards ensuring that all Americans (not in terms of citizenship but in terms of people living here) actually have a safe place to live.
<ul>
<li>Laws: I think there are a lot of ways that laws could help to solve this crisis. Apartment buildings could be required to include a certain percentage of low-income units, and cities could be required to do the same. In addition, there could be legal requirements around a certain number of rent-controlled units or even a maximum amount that rent could be across the city. Furthermore, there can be stricter laws regarding building codes &#8211; every apartment should have clean, running water and access to heat and electricity. I also think that there could be anti-discrimination laws for applicants who have previously faced eviction, as many people have trouble finding a new place to live once they have been evicted before.</li>
<li>Norms: A lot of the issues around the housing crisis are centered about race, and thus having some sort of campaign to push the benefits of diversity and inclusion within a community could help to temper worries about having buildings and communities include low-income residents. In addition, I think there is a huge learning opportunity for landlords to get training on seeing residents as more than just a cash grab.</li>
<li>Code: I think that software could be used to help set market prices for rent based on income levels. In addition, there could be a social-media type app that pairs up tenants to landlords and buildings. The app could show information that may help persuade landlords to give them an apartment (such as number of children, lack of prior convictions, etc.)</li>
<li>Market: Cities, buildings, and even landlords could get tax breaks for accommodating a certain number of low-income and previously evicted tenants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Food. I feel that there are a lot of issues with food in our country, but for now I&#8217;ll focus on just the idea of food deserts &#8211; areas where there is no access to fresh, high-quality food.
<ul>
<li>Laws: This one seems simple (though I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not). There should be a law mandating that there be a supermarket, with produce, for every x amount of people. In high-density areas there should be one within every square mile. On the flip side, there could be a limit to the number of fast food restaurants allowed in such an area. I also think that there could be stricter laws around food advertising &#8211; I know that some states now require the number of calories to be displayed but perhaps there could be more information that must be shared with consumers, such as ingredients and fruit/veggie servings.</li>
<li>Norms: I think one of the toughest to solve, as there are a lot of social norms around quick food. In addition, a lot of people don&#8217;t have a good sense of how to cook or what healthy food is. I think that things like local cooking classes or organized shopping trips could help to fix that. In addition, in thinking about norms, I think about a friend of mine who works for a social impact company in LA where they work with celebrities and TV/movie media to share positive messaging. Including things such as food shopping and cooking in popular TV shows may help to (perhaps subliminally) spread the message of better eating. I think another major norm that has to get addressed here is that people in certain areas wouldn&#8217;t appreciate having access to high-quality food in their neighborhood.</li>
<li>Code: Besides using coding techniques to help implement some of the laws and norms, I think there is also opportunity for a sort of traveling grocery store that could be tracked via an app. This may be easier for a short term solution in giving people access to high-quality food before grocery stores could be built.</li>
<li>Market: I think that tax breaks could be given to grocery stores that are built in food desert areas. In addition, farmers who travel to these areas to sell produce could also be given tax breaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Environment: of course the environment is another giant issue with many sub-issues that can be tackled. In particular, I&#8217;d like to focus on waste and recycling management.
<ul>
<li>Laws: Something that shocks me is that many states still do not seem to recycle. I think it should be a federal law that each state has to have its own recycling program. In addition, large corporations that manufacture things with plastic should be required to use at least some percentage of recycled materials. Also, I think that the plastic bag and styrofoam ban should be expanded nationally, and there should be a law requiring that all take out containers (at least for individuals) and disposable silverware is compostable.</li>
<li>Norms: I think that many people are unaware of the long-term environmental impact of things such as plastic and styrofoam. Finding ways through social media and education to show people these effects may help to change the norms.</li>
<li>Code: something I&#8217;ve seen in the local news lately is the issue of dirty recycling &#8211; people try to recycle but mistakenly put in things that cannot be recycled. I think software could be used to create smart recycling cans that separate out dirty recycling. This could even be extended to include smart trash cans that separate out recycling from trash. In addition, code has to be used to help create better compostable straws and spoons that don&#8217;t break down so quickly. I think another interesting angle for code here is to help figure out how we can handle the large amount of e-waste that is being generated from our electronic devices.</li>
<li>Market: I think tax breaks could be given to cities that generate less than a certain amount of trash per person. In addition, companies could be given tax breaks for using a certain amount of recycled materials in their production. They could also be given tax breaks for generating small amounts of trash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
