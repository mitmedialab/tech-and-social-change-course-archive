					<description><![CDATA[Mitagation Strategy For my project, Safeguarding DIY Biology, I will propose a mitigation strategy (regulation) that combines the levers of law, markets, and code. This issue, like the many other technology-focused projects discussed in our class, requires a multifaceted approach to anticipate and stem nefarious use-cases. Proposal: A centralized federal agency to oversee gene synthesis and biotechnology product licensing in the United States. Key Provisions: A presiding council consisting of members from the Environmental Protection [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#160; For my IDEO Design Research Method, I used the card &#8216;collage.&#8217; The activity involves having participants create a visual representation of the various sides of an issue. I chose this method because it allows for a secondary method of visual mapping, alongside the ecosystem map. While the ecosystem map does a good job of identifying the various stakeholders and how they are affiliated with the issue, in my case safeguarding DIYBiology, it doesn&#8217;t hold much [&#8230;]]]></description>

Naturally, there will be no fireworks or balloons or any of the celebratory devices that some of us older people remember from before they were banned. Instead people will celebrate with their environmentally friendly bubbles and compostable streamers. Against all odds, humanity has survived. Even many of [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Problem Statement: How might we help men recognize and share emotional (and other forms of gendered) labor? &#160; 10 Divergent Ideas: Present men with a list of gendered tasks and have them think of the last time someone did that for them, as well as the last time they did that. Challenge men to do a “feminine” task for 3 another male identifying person in their life and see how they react. Keep a labor [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having started from a very broad question the main challenge was finding the right balance of breadth and specificity for the HMW statement. To that end I went through the exercise and came up with a number of questions that I felt tackled both very specific and more general parts of the larger problem, e.g.: HMW make politics seem more consequential? HMW make civic participation and political engagement more fun? HMW make voters focus on [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As an overall update from this project, I have learned from method card, interviews and previous homework assignments, the topic of urban environmentalism is too large in scope to effectively pursue within this semester. However, as I have mentioned in my previous posts, I have found the following insights: decreasing the education gap to highlight issues of climate change making actions for environmentalism more convenient focusing on reducing large scale consumption via food and materialism [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HMW&#8230; Make gendered labor more desirable or socially acceptable to other gender(s)? View unequal gender ratio as a positive thing? Remove association of gender with gendered labor? Shape conversation about gender &#38; discrimination to be thoughtful, respectful, and natural, instead of contentious, annoying, and aggressive? Bring in people currently outside the conversation? Place gender in intersection with other aspects (e.g. race, ethnicity, religion, social class)? Make perception/awareness of daily and social work more like professional [&#8230;]]]></description>
